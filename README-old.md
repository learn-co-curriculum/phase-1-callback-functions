# Callback Functions

## Learning Goals

- Understand that we can pass functions as arguments in JavaScript
- Define callback functions

## Passing Functions as Arguments

We know we can pass numbers, strings, objects, and arrays into a function as
arguments, but did you know we can also **pass functions into other functions**?
We'll go into this in greater depth in an upcoming lesson, but it's important to
start thinking about this concept now: in JavaScript, **functions are objects**.
Specifically, they are objects with a special, hidden code property that can be
invoked.

This is how we pass an object into a function:

```js
function iReturnThings(thing) {
  return thing;
}

iReturnThings({ firstName: "Brendan", lastName: "Eich" });
// => {firstName: "Brendan", lastName: "Eich"}
```

And this is how we pass a function into a function:

```js
iReturnThings(function () {
  return 4 + 5;
});
// => ƒ () { return 4 + 5; }
```

Notice that a representation of the passed-in function was returned, but **it
was not invoked**. The `iReturnThings()` function accepted the passed-in
function as its lone argument, `thing`. As with all arguments, `thing` was then
available everywhere inside `iReturnThings()` as a local variable. When we
passed a function into `iReturnThings()`, the `thing` variable contained that
function. Currently, all `iReturnThings()` does is return whatever value is
stored inside `thing`. However, if we know `thing` contains a function, we can
do a piece of awesome, function-y magic to it: **we can invoke it** and return
the function's result:

```js
function iInvokeThings(thing) {
  return thing();
}

iInvokeThings(function () {
  return 4 + 5;
});
// => 9

iInvokeThings(function () {
  return "Hello, " + "world!";
});
// => "Hello, world!"
```

We pass in a function as the lone argument, store it inside the `thing`
variable, and then use the invocation operator (a pair of parentheses) to invoke
the stored function: `thing()`.

**_NOTE_**: As we dive deeper and deeper into functional programming in
JavaScript, it bears repeating: this is **very** complicated material! This is
likely the first time you're encountering any of this stuff so, if you're
struggling with the new concepts, don't sweat it! Set aside some extra time to
re-read and practice, and make sure you're coding along with every example we
cover in the lessons.

## Define Callback Functions

If you've done any outside reading on JavaScript, you've probably come across
the name of the pattern we just introduced: _callback functions_. When we pass a
function into another function wherein it might be invoked, we refer to the
passed function as a _callback_. The term derives from the fact that the
function isn't invoked immediately — instead it's _called back_, or invoked at a
later point. (As an example, callback functions are commonly used to respond to
user actions; we may define a callback to execute the appropriate code _when_
the user clicks an element on the page.)

You may have noticed, but all of our callback functions so far have been
_anonymous functions_; that is, we haven't assigned them an identifier. You're
welcome to name your callback functions if you'd like, but generally, it just
clutters things up if you only use the callback function in one place. And,
anyway, we already have a way to refer to them: by the name of the parameter
into which they're passed! For example:

```js
function main(cb) {
  console.log(cb());
}

main(function () {
  return "After I get passed to the main() function as the only argument, I'm stored in the local 'cb' variable!";
});
// LOG: After I get passed to the main() function as the only argument, I'm stored in the local 'cb' variable!
```

1. We passed an anonymous function, `function () { return "After I get passed...
}`, as the lone argument to our invocation of `main()`.
2. `main()` stored the passed-in function in the local `cb` variable and then
   invoked the callback function.
3. The invoked callback returned its long string, which was `console.log()`-ed
   out in `main()`.

We know that the parameters we define for our outer function are available
anywhere inside the function. As a result, we can pass them as arguments to the
callback function. For example:

```js
function greet(name, cb) {
  return cb(name);
}

greet("Ada Lovelace", function (name) {
  return "Hello there, " + name;
});
// => "Hello there, Ada Lovelace"

function doMath(num1, num2, cb) {
  return cb(num1, num2);
}

doMath(42, 8, function (num1, num2) {
  return num1 * num2;
});
// => 336
```

In the above examples, what the `greet()` and `doMath()` functions are doing is
pretty trivial: they're simply returning the result of calling the callback
function. But let's consider another example. Imagine for a moment that we have
a very expensive operation we need to execute, and that we need to do different
things with the data it returns at different points in our program. We can use a
callback to help us encapsulate that operation into its own function:

```javascript
function somethingExpensive(cb) {
  // do something crazy,
  // like fetching a bajillion websites
  // then pass their data to the callback:
  cb(data);
}
```

This approach allows us to separate the execution of the expensive operation from
the functions that use the data it returns. We do this by passing whichever
function we currently need to `somethingExpensive()` as a callback. Once the
expensive operation is finished, we simply call `cb()`, passing the data along
as an argument.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about JavaScript callback functions. If the topic
feels a little abstract at this point, don't worry! We will learn a lot more about
callback functions and how they can be used in upcoming lessons.
